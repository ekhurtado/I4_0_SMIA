   TODO
       This is a test to add a glossary of terms used in this project. We still need to add more and check how they link to Sphinx in the API documentation.

   Sphinx : GroupA
       Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

   RST : GroupB
       |RST| is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plain text markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. |RST| is designed for extensibility for specific application domains. The |RST| parser is a component of Docutils.

   API
       Application Programming Interface. A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

   Class
       A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize any object of the class.

   Function
       A block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

   IDE
       Integrated Development Environment. A software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software.

   Method
       A function that is associated with an object and has access to the object's data.

   Object
       An instance of a class. Objects can contain data and code that manipulates the data.

   Variable
       A storage location identified by a memory address and a symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

   AAS
       The Asset Administration Shell or AAS is the standardized digital representation of an asset (adapted from `Plattform I4.0 glossary <https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Navigation/EN/Industrie40/Glossary/glossary.html>`_ ).

   AAS Manager
       The AAS Manager is the common part of the AAS for all AAS types. It is responsible for managing the AAS and representing it in the I4.0 System and it is implemented as a :term:`Industrial Agent`. This agent will be part of a :term:`Multi-Agent System` composed of other AASs, each with their corresponding AAS Managers. The AAS Manager is provided by the platform in this approach, so the user only has to parameterise it.

   AAS Core
       The AAS Core is the specific part of the AAS that is closely related to the asset which the AAS is representing. The assets can be either logical or physical. The AAS Core is developed by the user for each case.
