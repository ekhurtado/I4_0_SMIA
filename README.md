## Project structure

The repository of the I4.0 SMIA project is structured as follows:

- [additional_tools](https://github.com/ekhurtado/Component_I4_0/tree/main/additional_tools): additional tools developed related to the I4.0 SMIA (i.e. a SPADE agent with a graphical interface that allows sending FIPA-ACL messages in a user-friendly way).
- [deploy](https://github.com/ekhurtado/Component_I4_0/tree/main/deploy): all the necessary resources for the deployment of the solution. As the execution platform is Kubernetes, these files are in YAML format.
- [src](https://github.com/ekhurtado/Component_I4_0/tree/main/src): the entire source code of the I4.0 SMIA. It is divided into two main subfolders:
  - [AAS_Cores](https://github.com/ekhurtado/Component_I4_0/tree/main/src/AAS_Cores): the code developed for the AAS Cores of the different use cases.
  - [AAS_Manager](https://github.com/ekhurtado/Component_I4_0/tree/main/src/AAS_Manager): the source code for the standardized AAS Manager.
