   .. TODO
   ..    This is a test to add a glossary of terms used in this project. We still need to add more and check how they link to Sphinx in the API documentation.

   ..  Sphinx : GroupA
       .. Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

   .. RST : GroupB
       .. |RST| is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plain text markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. |RST| is designed for extensibility for specific application domains. The |RST| parser is a component of Docutils.

   API
       Application Programming Interface. A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.

   Class
       A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize any object of the class.

   Function
       A block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

   IDE
       Integrated Development Environment. A software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software.

   Method
       A function that is associated with an object and has access to the object's data.

   Object
       An instance of a class. Objects can contain data and code that manipulates the data.

   Variable
       A storage location identified by a memory address and a symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

   Asset
      Physical, digital or intangible entity that has value to an individual, an organisation or a government (`IEC 63278-1 <https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/65628>`_).

   AAS
       The Asset Administration Shell or AAS is the standardized digital representation of an asset (adapted from `Plattform I4.0 glossary <https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Navigation/EN/Industrie40/Glossary/glossary.html>`_).

   Digital representation
       Information and services representing an entity from a given point of view (`IEC 63278-1 <https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/65628>`_).

   .. Inter AAS Interaction
      ..  Interaction type that takes place between I4.0 Components, i.e. between AASs (and therefore between AAS Managers). These interactions will follow FIPA-ACL, i.e. an AAS can request a service from another AAS.


   Industrial Agent
       An industrial agent is defined as a key enabler for industrial applications, focusing on core functionalities relevant to the application while often neglecting security and privacy aspects, especially in the context of cyber-physical systems and their utilization in industrial environments (see `ScienceDirect <https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/industrial-agent>`_).

   Multi-Agent System
        A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents, capable of perceiving their environment and taking decisions based on it. Typically agents refers to software agents, but could equally well be robots, humans or human teams. The work toward a common goal that goes beyond their individual goals, increasing the adaptability and robustness.

   SMIA
        The Self-configurable Manufacturing Industrial Agent approach: an AAS-compliant agent-based :term:`Digital Twin` (DT).

   Digital Twin
        Digital representation, sufficient to meet the requirements of a set of use cases (`Specification of the AAS Part 1: Metamodel <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications/specification-of-the-asset-administration-shell-part-1-metamodel-idta-number-01001-3-0-1>`_).
