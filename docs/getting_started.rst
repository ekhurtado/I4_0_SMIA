Getting Started
===============

SMIA is a software that implements an AAS-compliant Digital Twin (DT) that is based on a flexible manufacturing-centered ontology.

The features of the SMIA approach include:

    - free & open-source
    - AAS-compliant: standardized approach
    - Ontology-based
    - easily customizable and configurable
    - self-configuration at software startup
    - easy to usage
    - containerized solution

Additional tools
----------------

There are some additional tools offered within the SMIA approach. All of these tools are available in the GitHub repository.
