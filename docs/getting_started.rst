Getting Started
===============

SMIA is a software that implements an AAS-compliant Digital Twin (DT) that is based on a flexible manufacturing-centered ontology.

The features of the SMIA approach include:

    - free & open-source
    - AAS-compliant: standardized approach
    - Ontology-based
    - easily customizable and extendable
    - self-configuration at software startup
    - easy to start-up
    - containerized solution

Documentation project structure
-------------------------------

The SMIA project documentation repository is structured as follows:

    :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`SMIA User Guide`: these guides helps with the usage of SMIA software and related tools.

    .. :octicon:`repo;1em` :ref:`AAS Developer Guide`: this guide helps with the development of the :term:`AAS model`, that is the basis for SMIA self-configuration.

    :octicon:`code-review;1em` :ref:`API documentation`: the entire documented source code of SMIA software.

    :octicon:`book;1em` :ref:`Glossary`: the glossary shows the list of terms relating to the SMIA approach.

    :octicon:`versions;1em` :ref:`Contributing`: shows the different ways to contribute to the SMIA approach.

    :octicon:`info;1em` :ref:`About the Project`: general information about the SMIA approach (e.g. contact information).

    :octicon:`link-external;1em` :ref:`Recommended Links`: information related to SMIA approach is available in this section.
