- `Asset Administration Shell Specifications <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications>`_: Specifications define the software structure, interface and semantics of the Asset Administration Shell.

    - `Specification of the Asset Administration Shell Part 1: Metamodel <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications/specification-of-the-asset-administration-shell-part-1-metamodel-idta-number-01001-3-0-1>`_ (V3.0): This part of the document focuses on how information needs to be processed and structured in the AAS. In order to define these specifications, the document formally stipulates some structural principles of the Administration Shell.
    - `Specification of the Asset Administration Shell Part 2: Application Programming Interfaces <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications/specification-of-the-asset-administration-shell-part-2-application-programming-interfaces-idta-number-01002-3-0-3>`_ (V3.0): This document specifies the interfaces as well as the APIs in selected technologies for the Asset Administration Shells and its Submodels.
    - `Specification of the Asset Administration Shell Part 3a: Data Specification – IEC 61360 <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications/specification-of-the-asset-administration-shell-part-3a-data-specification-iec-61360-idta-number-01003-a-3-0-2>`_ (V3.0): This document specifies data specification templates conformant to IEC 61360. IEC 61360 specifies how to define the semantics of single properties or values.
    - `Specification of the Asset Administration Shell Part 5: Package File Format (AASX) <https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/aasspecifications/specification-of-the-asset-administration-shell-part-5-package-file-format-aasx-idta-number-01005-3-0-1>`_ (V3.0): This document focuses on the exchange file format to enable the meaningful exchange of information about assets between partners in a value creation network.

- Capability-Skill-Service (CSS) model documents

    - `Describing Capabilities of Industrie 4.0 Components, Plattform Industrie 4.0; VDI GMA 7.20, BaSys 4.2; 2020 <https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/Capabilities_Industrie40_Components.html>`_: describes the means of capability and skill to achieve the provision of both standardised, machine-interpretable data and information about the functionality it provides.
    - `Information Model for Capabilities, Skills & Services; working Group "Semantic and Interaction of I4.0 Components" of Plattform; 2022 <https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/CapabilitiesSkillsServices.html>`_: presents the information model on capabilities, skills and services (CSS model). It creates an understanding of how these three elements can be optimally used for new production concepts and as a basis for future standardization activities.
    - `A reference model for common understanding of capabilities and skills in manufacturing; A. Köcher et al.; 2023 <https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/auto-2022-0117/html?lang=en>`_: based on these papers, this scientific paper presents the definitive CSS model.

-  `Additional links <https://github.com/ekhurtado/I4_0_SMIA>`__: The articles that will be published with this PhD thesis, and other related articles or links (videos, data...) are still to be added.
